    /*  I decided that an exam had a set of questions, that can be of different types (stored in an enum class). 
        An exam is taken by several students. Each student has a name and an id. 
        And we keep track of how many students and how many questions there are (thanks to static variables) to give a unique id to every student/question.
        Each student gives a set of answers that can be compared with the correction and then graded by the professor.
        An answer has a question type and a question number/id (to know what question the answer corresponds to 
        and a studentID to know what student has given this answer. If the student id is 0, it is the correction.
